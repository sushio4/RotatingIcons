# RotatingIcons
It's just a small program to make my desktop icons spin. Nothing more, it's not even customizable.

The closest icon to the center of the screen will be stationary and other will spin around it.

It's becomes a cool feature if added to the autostart folder. Especially with blackhole as your desktop background ;)

As of now, you have to close it via task manager, but maybe I'll make v2.0 one day...
